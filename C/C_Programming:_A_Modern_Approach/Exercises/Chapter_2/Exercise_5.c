//	Which of the following are not legal C identifiers?

//	(a) 100_bottles
//	(b) _100_bottles
//	(c) one__hundred__bottles
//	(d) bottles_by_the_hundred_

/*	ANSWER	*/

//	The (a) variant is not legal because it's beginning with digit. In C language we can use only those identifiers which begin with a letter or an underscore.
